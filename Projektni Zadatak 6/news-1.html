			<h2>Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland announces 70 new episodes</h2>
			<p class="description">There is no set date for the return of the Adult Swim hit show</p>
			<p>Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland has confirmed that he's making 70 more episodes of the Adult Swim series. Roiland - the co-creator and voice actor of the show - tweeted the news of a fourth season on Thursday. Alongside the tweet was a drawing that said, "May 10, 2018. Rick and Morty. 70 more episodes."</p>
			<p>When fans asked if the news was real, Gravity Falls actor Alex Hirsch replied, "I can confirm this is real. It's real Morty. Skud is real. He's REAL. He's REAAAALL. SKUD IS REALLLLLL MORTY. HES REAL. SKUD IS RRREEEEEAAAAAALLLLL." </p>
			<p>Earlier this year, Rick and Morty writer Ryan Ridley revealed the series hadn't begun production, which would indicate the show would likely not come out in 2018 or even 2018. Ridley further said the scripts for Rick and Morty's third season were completed in November 2016 and premiered eight months later on Adult Swim. He told Hypebeast: "They really take their time. I never understood why everybody - all parties, Dan, Justin, and Adult Swim - didn’t get their shit together, and make the show fast. I just don’t get it. It doesn’t make any sense to me." </p>
			<p>"I’m sure they all have their reasons," Ridley continued. "I know how long this show takes to write, let alone animate. I’d be surprised if there was a fourth season on the air anytime sooner than 2019… late 2019. Get your s*** together, you guys. Get it all together, and put it in a backpack." Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon told Entertainment Weekly he didn't know when production would begin. Considering Adult Swim renewed the hit series back in March, Roiland's news makes sense. As of now, there's no set release date for the fourth season of Rick and Morty.  </p>
