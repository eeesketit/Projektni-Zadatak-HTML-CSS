			<h2>Is Rick and Morty about to release a Christmas episode ahead of season 4?</h2>
			<p class="description">There's certainly a precedent with surprise episodes</p>
			<p>It's been almost a year and a half since the last episode of Rick and Morty aired, which must mean it's time for fans of the show to start demanding new instalments. A theory has been circulating this week that, just as season 3 started with a surprise April Fool's Day episode, season 4 will begin with an unexpected Christmas one. Attention has been drawn to the fact that the inimitable Mr Poopy Butthole said at the end of season 2: "Tune into Rick and Morty season 3, in like, a year and a half – or longer!" and sure enough the third season did arrive a year and a half later. </p>
			<p>Now, the character wasn't quite as specific on the timeframe when he capped off the last batch of episodes, saying: "See ya for season four in like … a really long time! I might even have a big, white Santa Claus beard!" but fans have latched onto the possible Christmas reference. Adult Swim has ordered a staggering 70 episodes of Rick and Morty for season 4, which will take a long time to create given the creators are notoriously slow to complete the complex scripts. Might they decide to tide the fandom over by throwing it a standalone Christmas episode? Given last year's mini Thanksgiving episode, it does feel like the sort of thing Rick and Morty might do. </p>
