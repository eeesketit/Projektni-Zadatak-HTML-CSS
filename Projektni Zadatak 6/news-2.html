			<h2>McDonald's bringing back Szechuan sauce again, thanks to Rick and Morty fans</h2>
			<p class="description">20 million packet are incoming</p>
			<p>McDonald’s has decided to bring back its infamous Szechuan sauce, this time hoping to avoid a massive fiasco that caught employees off guard. Last year, the TV show Rick and Morty featured a joke concerning McDonald’s limited edition Szechuan sauce, released alongside the 1998 Disney movie Mulan.  </p>
			<p>As a result, thousands of fans signed a petition demanding the fast food chain bring back the sauce, McDonald’s eventually giving into demand and releasing a batch.  McDonald’s released a “limited” number of packets on the 7 October, but not nearly enough for the legions of fans who arrived at restaurants, police being called to some as outrage spread. </p>
			<p>Polygon has since received a press release detailing how 20 million packets of Szechuan sauce will be shipped to McDonald’s restaurants on the 26 February. They will be available while quantities last.  The fast food chain will also be releasing a three-episode podcast — titled The Sauce — alongside the sauce, detailing how the initial fiasco happened. </p>
			<p>According to the statement, the podcast will feature “real interviews with McDonald’s corporate executives and Chef Mike, angered Sauce lovers and even electronic DJ Deadmau5 [who famously paid a lot of money for some Szechuan sauce] for a glimpse into what happened.” Meanwhile, there’s been no update on the fourth season of Rick and Morty. In Mr Poopybutthole’s words, we’re going to be waiting a “really long time”. </p>
